## I have been wanting to do this project for a long time. I have had this vacuum flourecent display for almost twenty years now with hopes of using in a project. I briefly used it for a WinAMP information display, or maybe as vu meters back then, but not for any significant length of time. I am actually writing this readme.md on this device that I have built now. It's not complete yet, just wires and some plastic tupperware holding it up on my desk but it is a working text editor and thats what matters. 

### Specifications
We are using a Noritake CU40026SCPB-S20A VFD wired up to a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It was originally going to be a Pi Pico W, but the keyboard input was too difficult for my needs. The Pi Zero W simplified a lot of things. The editor is written in Python as are the libraries for the VFD. If anyone ever builds another one of these CONTACT ME I'd be honored to take a look at your build!
